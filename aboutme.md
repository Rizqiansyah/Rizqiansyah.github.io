My name is Akbar Rizqiansyah. I'm a PhD candidate at Monash University, Melbourne, Australia. 
My topic is in Bridge Engineering. 
I'm interested in:
- Application of extreme value for prediction of live loading.
- Bayesian statistics and hierarchical modelling.
- Using engineering knowledge for modelling.
- Long-term simulation of bridge loading.

Other topics I'm interested in, but not a main focus:
- Reliability engineering
- Value of information
- Machine learning
